# rpi-basilisk2-sdl2-nox

This script will automatically download and compile all the necessary source code to have a fully functional Basilisk II emulator running with SDL2 and _without_ X Windows for maximum performance. In order to have an extremely light Linux system the Raspberry Pi OS Lite was chosen as the base for this project. As of this writing the following versions were used:
```plaintext
Raspberry Pi OS Lite version 2024-11-19-raspios-buster-armhf-lite
SDL2 version 2.26.5
Basilisk II version by kanjitalk755
```
Due to graphics hardware incompatibilities between RPi3 (VideoCore 4) and RPi4 (VideoCore VI), this script recommends running on a RPi versions 1, 2, or 3.

A 200MB disk image is also included here with pre-installed Mac OS 7.6.1 and Prince of Persia 1 for a quick demonstration of sound and graphics at 640x480 and 256 colors.

## Getting started

### Requirements
- A Raspberry Pi
- A blank SD card
- Your Raspberry Pi is connected to a network

### Assumptions
- Your username for the raspberry pi is "pi"
- Your password is "raspberry"
_It is recommened that you change these_

### Step 1: Create a fresh Raspibian Lite image

1. Download and launch the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
2. Insert a blank SD card
3. Select your Raspberry Pi Device
4. Select Raspbian Lite as the OS, it's under **Raspberry Pi OS (other)**
5. Select the SD card as your storage device
6. Click next
7. Optional: Customise settings e.g. hostname, username and password, wifi settings
8. Proceed through the confirmation screens
9. When the SD card has been prepared eject it

### Step 2: Install Basilisk II

To install Basilisk II, boot your Raspberry Pi from the freshly created SD card.

You may need to wait for the Pi to complete a few steps such as generating SSH keys and reszing the partition on the SD card.
When promted to login use the username "pi" and password "raspberry", unless you have changed them.

Once you have logged in run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt install git -y
git clone https://github.com/adamhope/rpi-basilisk2-sdl2-nox
cd rpi-basilisk2-sdl2-nox
bash run.sh
```
**Note**: The script will prompt you to update the system software.
- If you press `y` the system will update and you will need to re-run the following commands after logging in again:
```bash
cd rpi-basilisk2-sdl2-nox
bash run.sh
```
- If you press any other key Basilisk II will install and launch automatically.

When Mac OS is running you can select `Shutdown` in the `special` menu to return to the command line. You can manually start Basilisk II at any time by typing `BasiliskII`. Enjoy!

## Taking things further

The following steps are optional.

### Configuring Basilisk II

Basilisk II is a highly configurable emulator. It is likely that you'll want to change some of the default configuration options e.g.
- Path(s) to different hard drive images
- Changing the screen resolution, depending on which version of Mac OS you are emulating you won't always be able to do this directly in the guest vesion of Mac OS and you'll have to make changes in `~/.basilisk_ii_prefs` instead.

#### Adding a different hard drive image
Basilisk II supports using multiple hard disk images. You can add aditional drive images by copying them in to your home folder and adding them to `~/.basilisk_ii_prefs` e.g:
```plaintext
disk /home/pi/<name of disk image>
```

#### Changing display settings
You can change the screen resolution by editing the `~/.basilisk_ii_prefs` and modifying the `screen` parameter. For some serious work, you can try the following:
```plaintext
screen dga/1024/768
displaycolordepth 16
```
Then go to Mac OS 7.6.1 Control Panel and under Monitors, select "Thousands" of colors.

_Note: Many older games require 256 colours and will report an error if Thousands (16 bit) is selected._

#### Changing keyboard mapping
There is a folder called `keyboard` that has the default raw keycodes used by Basilisk II. Basically it converts the host OS scancodes into the emulated Basilisk II keycodes. This allows the ALT and WINDOWS keys to be assigned the COMMAND and OPTION keys respectively. There are many keycode sets depending on which video driver is being used, e.g. X11, Quartz, Linux framebuffer, Cocoa, or Windows. This is especially needed when using non-QWERTY keyboard layouts.

_Note: If you are using an ADB keyboard with an ADB to USB adapter this will result in the command and option keys being swapped._

### Start Basilisk II automatically on boot

These instructions will guide you through configuring your Raspberry Pi running Raspbian to **boot directly into Basilisk II** for a more seamless emulator experience. There is a 5 second delay where you can press a key to stay on the command line.

#### Step 1: Start Basilisk II automatically

Copy basilisk_autostart.sh to your home directory and make it executable:

```bash
cd ~
cp rpi-basilisk2-sdl2-nox/basilisk_autostart.sh .
chmod +x basilisk_autostart.sh
```

Open the /etc/rc.local file for editing:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

Add the following line before the exit 0 line:
```bash
/home/pi/basilisk_autostart.sh &
```
Save and exit by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter.

#### Step 2: Hide boot messages
Open cmdline.txt:
```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
```
Add the following options to the end of the line:
```plaintext
quiet splash
```
Save and exit by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter.

#### Step 3: Enable Auto-Login to Console using raspi-config
```bash
sudo raspi-config
```
Navigate to System Options > Boot / Auto Login.
Select Console Auto Login.

Reboot your Raspberry Pi to test the configuration:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

#### Step 4: Cutting down boot time by skipping systemd

Using an unmodified Raspberry Pi OS is not really suitable because the boot time is too long and too much stuff goes on on beforel macOS is booted. By skipping systemd one can dramatically cut down the boot process using a custom init script that just runs the bare minimum needed.

Open the `~/basilisk_autostart.sh` file for editing:
```bash
sudo nano ~/basilisk_autostart.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mount / -o remount,rw
exec > /dev/null 2>&1
export HOME=/home/pi
cd ~
/usr/local/bin/BasiliskII
mount / -o remount,ro
sync
poweroff -f
```

Save and exit by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter.

Remove it from `/etc/rc.local` (that file never existed on my system in the first place).

Open cmdline.txt:
```bash
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
```

Add the following options to the end of the line:

```plaintext
quiet fastboot init=/home/pi/basilisk_autostart.sh
```
Save and exit by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter.
